# Code for EUMBR

**Unpack Features and Annotations**
* Unpack the file under *./data* (or elsewhere and link to *./data*).
* The folder structure should look like
```
This folder
│   README.md
│   ...  
│
└───data/
│    └───thumos/
│    │	 └───annotations
│    │	 └───i3d_features   
│    └───...
|
└───libs
│
│   ...
```

**Training and Evaluation**
* Train our EUMBR with I3D features. This will create an experiment folder under *./ckpt* that stores training config, logs, and checkpoints.
```shell
python ./train.py ./configs/thumos_i3d.yaml --output reproduce
```
* Evaluate the trained model. 
```shell
python ./eval.py ./configs/thumos_i3d.yaml ./ckpt/thumos_i3d_reproduce
```
